You got better model evaluation on v2, but you don't know for certain that it is really better until you deploy to production. So in the case of traffic split, you might want to deploy v2 to the same endpoint as v1, but it only get's say 10% of the traffic. That way, you can monitor how well it does without disrupting the majority of users -- until you make a final decision."
