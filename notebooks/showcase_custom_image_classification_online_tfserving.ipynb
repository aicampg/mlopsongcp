During upload, you need to define a serving function to convert data to the format your model expects. If you send encoded data to AI Platform (Unified), your serving function ensures that the data is decoded on the model server before it is passed as input to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the serving function work\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send a request to an online prediction server, the request is received by a HTTP server. The HTTP server extracts the prediction request from the HTTP request content body. The extracted prediction request is forwarded to the serving function. For Google pre-built prediction containers, the request content is passed to the serving function as a `tf.string`.\n",

    "  - Converts the input (`tf.string`) to the input shape and data type of the underlying model (dynamic graph).\n",

    "- `post-processing function`:\n",
    "  - Converts the model output to format expected by the receiving application -- e.q., compresses the output.\n",
    "  - Packages the output for the the receiving application -- e.g., add headings, make JSON object, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the preprocessing and post-processing functions are converted to static graphs which are fused to the model. The output from the underlying model is passed to the post-processing function. The post-processing function passes the converted/packaged output back to the HTTP server. The HTTP server returns the output as the HTTP response content.\n",
    "\n",
    "One consideration you need to consider when building serving functions for TF.Keras models is that they run as static graphs. That means, you cannot use TF graph operations that require a dynamic graph. If you do, you will get an error during the compile of the serving function which will indicate that you are using an EagerTensor which is not supported."

Since this deployed model expects input data as raw (uncompressed) bytes, you need to ensure that the base 64 encoded data gets converted back to raw bytes before it is passed as input to the deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, define a serving function (`serving_fn`) and attach it to the model as a preprocessing step. Add a `@tf.function` decorator so the serving function is fused to the underlying model (instead of upstream on a CPU).\n",

    "- `model`: The AI Platform (Unified) fully qualified model identifier of the (upload) model to deploy.\n",
    "- `display_name`: A human readable name for the deployed model.\n",
    "- `disable_container_logging`: This disables logging of container events, such as execution failures (default is container logging is enabled). Container logging is typically enabled when debugging the deployment and then disabled when deployed for production.\n",
    "- `dedicated_resources`: This refers to how many compute instances (replicas) that are scaled for serving prediction requests.\n",
    "  - `machine_spec`: The compute instance to provision. Use the variable you set earlier `DEPLOY_GPU != None` to use a GPU; otherwise only a CPU is allocated.\n",
    "  - `min_replica_count`: The number of compute instances to initially provision, which you set earlier as the variable `MIN_NODES`.\n",
    "  - `max_replica_count`: The maximum number of compute instances to scale to, which you set earlier as the variable `MAX_NODES`.\n",

    "Let's now dive deeper into the `traffic_split` parameter. This parameter is specified as a Python dictionary. This might at first be a tad bit confusing. Let me explain, you can deploy more than one instance of your model to an endpoint, and then set how much (percent) goes to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you do that? Perhaps you already have a previous version deployed in production -- let's call that v1. You got better model evaluation on v2, but you don't know for certain that it is really better until you deploy to production. So in the case of traffic split, you might want to deploy v2 to the same endpoint as v1, but it only get's say 10% of the traffic. That way, you can monitor how well it does without disrupting the majority of users -- until you make a final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Response\n",
    "\n",
    "The method returns a long running operation `response`. We will wait sychronously for the operation to complete by calling the `response.result()`, which will block until the model is deployed. If this is the first time a model is deployed to the endpoint, it may take a few additional minutes to complete provisioning of resources."
