    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the AI Platform (Unified) Python SDK to train and deploy a custom image classification model for A/B testing of online predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is the [cifar10 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10) from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview). The version of the dataset you will use is built into Tensorflow. The trained model predicts which type of class an image is from ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to create multiple instances of a custom model from a Python script in a docker container using the AI Platform (Unified) SDK, and then deploy for A/B testing\n",
    "of online predictions. You can alternatively create custom models from the command line using `gcloud` or online using Google Cloud Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an AI Platform (Unified) custom job for training a model.\n",
    "- Train two instances (A and B) of the model.\n",
    "- Retrieve and load the models (artifacts).\n",
    "- View the models evaluation.\n",
    "- Upload each model instance as a AI Platform (Unified) model.\n",
    "- Deploy the model instances to the same serving endpoint.\n",
    "- Make a prediction.\n",
    "- Review the results from the two model instances. \n",
    "- Undeploy the model instances.\n",
